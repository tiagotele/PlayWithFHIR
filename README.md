# FHIR structure

Playing around with FHIR resources.

Is possible to test it agains a FHIR server.

There is a public server [availble here](https://wiki.hl7.org/Publicly_Available_FHIR_Servers_for_testing). I tested with [this one](https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/swagger-ui/).

It's also possible to test against local FHRI servers.
